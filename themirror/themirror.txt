when you see things as they are, without judgement
see what you see, move how you move, freely.
the mind will retain those still images.. the perfect image.
everybody has a perfect image.. and that image is how you see them
the more perfectly you see, the more perfect the world will become

retaining images for a period of time, only.. (I assign %'s of importance)
is this important? and how much

if you look back, it only gets muddier and muddier.. judgement upon judgement, out-of-context and continuing to influence your mind and future decisions.

the. mirror.
