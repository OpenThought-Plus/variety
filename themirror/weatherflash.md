re the below :: this is a human exercise involving people, in groups - to affect the weather.. specifically in groups of n. in three(3) phased coordination towards, in this case. the **SF Bay**. to clear atmospheric pollution.

the brief **::** in case you're not into the maths, is that :: a small group, say 5, create a sky observation towards the bay. this coordinated push is then picked up by our 2nd crew, to *balloon bump* while all travel to the sea side.. for final push and drop with **fov_ll** *localized drop*

there are very careful maths about non-observation, i.e. when **a power is set to motion ::**

we start with our heros, {field of view}_**d**. with the coordinated **o**bservation towards the bay

the **fov_b** team is contribute in a ripple so that dest. is met.

**fov_ll** with all crew, ensures the **fov_d** and **fov_b** balloon hit dest. with minimal dispersion/artifacts of **o**bservation

##here are the maths

  :: let's call that **fov_d**{dest}

**:: implementations for**

   **:: fov_d**
	{ o->dest with E-> {{ directional spot o->dest) at apex for arc to reach crew **fov_b** {light crew} 
        place **fov_ll** based on {time|wind|probability to dest. with crew}
        **fov_d** maintaines for **fov_b** and proceeds to **fov_b** for additional needed ripple
         (fov_d o-o->atmos. must be only conducted as a group: as spurious group o->dest. will interfere with the balloon
           and eff' the hell out of fov_b and your work towards dest. 
         :: seperate group with fov_b to assist with {their below}; then proceed with fov_b towards dest as condiditions optimal.

   **:: fov_b**
          for ripple to {face the ocean!} {you'll need need eyes on sky for this facing inbound **fov_d**}
          
{this is precise :: you'll need to face inbound's **fov_d**; otherwise your **fov_b** won't provide for **fov_d**
           and thus miss dest.
	  {future eQ on fov_b group; but directional and sky o. should be sufficient}
          **fov_d** will arrive to assist the ripple towards dest.  don't distract them, and take cues.
          by then, **fov_ll** et. **all proceed to dest8* with minimal **o**(bervation)

          you'll be facing the *opposite directional* of **fov_d** crew, to provide lift, via
            creating a sort of weather bubble
            
**:: this is the widest arc and should be limited to say 5 people to start**

:: your observational job is to start with eye-lines faced opposite **fov_d**, with a coordinated circular
                **o** lift
                (you're launching the *balloon*)
                
:: **fov_d** has already provided the placement of small crew **fov_ll** and provide feedback on efficacy after *{experiment 1}*

:: your coordination will be **to lose o.(bservation) with the balloon, group your fov_ll's to proceed within your own**

{GROUP!} to dest for final localized push with **fov_d,_b,_ll**
