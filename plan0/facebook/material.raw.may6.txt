next time you go in.. ask them if they are 'aztecian' .. and they'll say 'what?' and you say 'exactly.. dicks' OR alternatively.. they say 'YES!' and you can say 'then I'll take some.. to-go .. home .. I'm an ex-american too' :P

If I figure out the meaning of life, but die before I'm able to tell anybody.. does it matter to the living? (adaptation of h2g2 'Woman nailed to a tree for trying to be nice to one another)

perhaps alzheimer's (and EFF YOU spelling check, I know I spelled it right).... is just not giving a fuck, for things that don't give a fuck... so.. give a fuck and promote them to their next level... I started this thought more eloquently .. just make sure they don't burn their hands on the stove :)

I just hope the 1600 cook staff will poison him.. not like /actual/ poison.. but more like.. correlating his health conditions with an adverse diet... like.. e.g. putting 20 kinds of burgers on the menu every night.. followed with freedom-brunch hollandaise on a daily basis.. j/s

ever notice how republicans never march for things?


they say, "if you don't have something nice to say.. then don't say anything at all".. but perhaps they should tell you how stupid you are for not being able to come up with something nice.. I realize that voids the rules.. fuck the rules.. unless you're making them nice for people :P

I'm ahead of my own time.
